# 42libft

This is my C functions library, my first project as a cadet at School 42 SÃ£o Paulo. It has functions to manipulate strings, memory, and linked list, and I will expand this in the future when necessary.

## Included Functions

### First section

| Name  | Description  |

| [ft_memset](/ft_memset.c) | Fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte c. |
| [ft_bzero](/ft_bzero.c)   | Erases the data in the n bytes of the memory starting at the location pointed to by s, by writing zeroes, (bytes containing '\0') to that area. |
